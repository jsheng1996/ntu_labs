# CZ 2003 Computer Graphics and Visualization

This course aims to introduce methods for visualizing data, especially in cases where simple plots
and diagrams are insufficient. Information visualization and graphics rendering of abstract data
involves various mathematical models, and has become important in modern science and
technology. It has applications across many disciplines including interior and architectural designs,
as well as engineering software systems that employ graphical presentations as part of their user
interfaces. You will be immersed into “visual mathematics”, i.e. you will learn how to see
geometry and colours beyond mathematical formulas and how to represent geometric shapes and
motions by analytic functions and algorithmic procedures. You will develop spatial visualization
skills which will permit you to perform 3D rotations and other transformations of geometric
objects. You will also learn how a common personal computer, freeware and de‐facto standard
software can be used for solving complex computer graphics problems. The course requires
knowledge of engineering math and analytic geometry.
